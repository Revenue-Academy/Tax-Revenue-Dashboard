This dashboard uses data from [UNU Wider Government Revenue Dataset (GRD) dataset](https://www.wider.unu.edu/project/grd-%E2%80%93-government-revenue-dataset) along with some additional calculations done by World Bank Fiscal Policy and Sustainable Growth (FPSG) Team. We are using Frontier Analysis in Stata to do these additional calculations.

This repository includes latest source code, important data and metadata files, and Tableau files for Tax Revenue Dashboard

These files also include some data transformation, and validation code to ensure data integrity. Currently we are using clsTaxRevenueDashboard.py file to convert the data from raw to final format.
